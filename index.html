      <h3>Nassir</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Resident Low-Life</p>
      <p>One of four original league members (2006), Uncle Nasty has been paying out winners for the past 15 years. He probably has a porn addiction, but his biggest vice is how much love he has to give. This LA socialist hates early mornings unless he hasn’t slept yet. Lube up fellas, it’s anal night at the Al-Joulanis.</p>

      <h3>Andrew</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">The Don</p>
      <p>VP-erect Harris has come along way since his stint as California’s Attorney General. Even more impressive, considering that less than ten years ago he was kicked out of the family hotel room for sharing that the ‘stripper wiped his glasses on her pussy’. The Don is a Zeeen League OG, being part of the very first circuit back in ‘06. Don’t ask him about the CFL or fences unless you want your face rearranged.</p>

      <h3>Kevin</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Moose</p>
      <p>Kevin the tech whiz is equally known for his brilliant spreadsheets and inability to swim. This pervert is ready for COVID to end so he can get back to spending his evenings and weekends with youth football players. Moose is a visionary, concocting the first ever 3 TE draft day strategy which was later replicated by Harris in 2020. Piece of advice: if you have a few units to spend, don’t ever fucking spend them on the Detroit Lions.</p>

      <p class="w3-opacity">Cousin-Connoisseur</p>
      <p>Keeping pace with his dog Norman, Gemin’s manhood was removed in September when he skipped the draft to tend to his dog’s balls. Famous for showing his cousins a good time, this no nonsense mega stoner doesn’t care what you think. He relishes his role as league villain and wouldn’t have it any other way. (need closing line maybe)</p>

      <p class="w3-opacity">Creamy Commish</p>
      <p>Once the cream of the fantasy crop, Carrsy hasn’t made the playoffs in two years or won in three years. Sam is a great friend for a smoker, as he’s notorious for buying a pack of darts and smoking one. He’s a somewhat corrupt, fun-loving, whiskey drinking commissioner. We love him for hosting everything but there is one burning question… Who hosts a BBQ and only has relish???</p>

      <h3>Joel</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Chint Bud Light Chint</p>
      <p>He hates that they won’t call him Chint Bud Light Chint at work. This minivan-driving family man considers this to be his second favorite fantasy league as he thinks most of the group are a bunch of ‘pussies’. It’s hard to argue with him there. Rumour has it Joeler absolutely FILLS his condoms.</p>

      <h3>Jon</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Waiver Warrior</p>
      <p>Jon has worked tirelessly to put his stamp on the league the past five years, mostly during drunk rants after 2 am. League history was made in 2020 when Jon finally whipped enough votes for us to ‘try’ FAAB waivers for a season, a coup that truly divided the league for atleast ten minutes. Jon is the league attorney and his 11 clients (us) are constantly suing each other. It’s a thankless job, but someone has to do it.</p>

      <h3>Dmitro</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity"></p>
      <p>Our resident bone doctor is the career leader in Facebook group posts with zero likes or interactions. He’s also been a staple in BBW hillbilly chat forums since 2010. His two year reign conveniently ended this season after FAAB waivers were added. Coincidence? Jon sure doesn’t think so. The only thing lazier than this bastard’s work ethic is his left eye.</p>

      <h3>Andy</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">A-Mac n Cheese</p>
      <p>This 3 time national spelling bee champion backdoored his way into the league a few years ago and hasn’t looked back. His perpetual criticism of Sam has really improved activity in the Facebook group and he loves asking other GMs for fantasy and dating advice. Make sure you hit him up in July/August when he gets the best deals on Raybans.</p>

      <h3>Brett</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">The Generator</p>
      <p>Storming onto the fantasy scene in 2014, Kinkley continues to make & perform in the playoffs despite rarely watching football. This electrical genius is known for fixing everything except mouses, monitors and keyboards. He usually breaks those. Brett handed out company hats at the draft this year, but does the company really want 12 degenerate morons wearing their logos while breaking the law?</p>
